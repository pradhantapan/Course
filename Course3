Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Tapan Pradhan
Algorithm Analysis
Time complexity and space complexity. Big-O notation to represent complexity. Big-O represents the complexity in worst case mostly.
Big-O is determined in terms of n -> number of input items to be processed
